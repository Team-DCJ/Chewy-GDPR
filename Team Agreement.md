# <p align="center"> Team Agreement

To begin our journey, the team is putting together a Team Agreement for the project. This agreement function is to set clear guidelines on how we will collaborate through the duration of said project.
Since projects can be stressful and bring a not so nice side of us, it’s always important to set some clear expectations and rules for the team. The safety and security of the group will have the highest priority among all. Deadlines, goals and accountability are a vital part of the project but we will also try to work around some curveballs that may arrive in the process.

## Planning
An 1-hour meeting needs to be held to go over the whole project. The requirements for the Team agreement have to be reviewed and a consensus reached on how to handle each of them.

## Deliverable(s)
A public-facing GitHub markdown file has to be created and include the following components in the team agreement submission.

### Cooperation Plan
Every person on the team is an asset. Each member has hidden strengths and areas for growth.

**Key strengths of each team member**
* Devin: Coding, creative problem solving (thinking outside the box), innovative (looking to advance/improve processes). 
* Chris: Great memory for details, excellent troubleshooting skills, breaking down the problem at hand and presenting ideas on how to fix it.  
* Jeremy: Communication, leadership traits, prioritization of tasks.   

**How to utilize these strengths in the execution of the project**
* Jeremy: Helps create/maintain the foundation/skelton of the project, prioritizes tasks. 
* Chris: Brings solutions to roadblocks and is able to bring ideas to the table, recall important details regarding processes. 
* Devin: Breaks down barriers we have encountered, adds functionality to scripts and overall project.    

**Each member wants to develop greater strength on the following professional competencies**
* Chris: Craft, Communication. 
* Devin: Results, growth mindset. 
* Jeremy: Business acumen, craft.   

**Approach to day-to-day work, so every member can understand all aspects of the project**
* The team will have a period of time (5-10 minutes) at the beginning of project work time to go over what we are working on, roadblocks, doubts, concerns, brainstorming solutions and goals to accomplish for the night.
NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments.

### Conflict Plan
The team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. Plan to refer back if necessary.  

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**  
* Talk about it like adults.  

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**  
* Call them out respectfully.

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**  
* We will approach it as a unified group, if someone is stuck we are all stuck essentially. Team members will do their best to help troubleshoot problems and offer insights to help address roadblocks.   

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**  
* During group meetings at the beginning of class time we will bring it up in a respectful manner, go over what each person is working on and what our responsibilities are for the overall project.  
If someone is behind, approach them and say “What are you stuck on, is there anything we can do to help”. 

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**  
* If someone is behind, after we have hinted at their low contribution or discussed assigned responsibilities and they have not yet made attempts or changes. Then the team will approach the member and communicate in a way that is constructive and straight to the point. 
 
### Communication Plan
In order for everyone to feel comfortable speaking up, the team should determine how the group will communicate with each other before beginning the project. All needs should be taken into account respecting each other’s time availability.
  
**What hours will you be available to communicate?** 
* Chris: Will be available until 10pm PST Monday-Saturday because of time zone differences.
* Devin: 5:30-11:00pm Monday-Friday. All day Saturday. All day Thursday as well.  
* Jeremy: 5:30-11:00pm Monday-Friday. All day Saturday (can be available out of these hours if needed). 
* Everyone will take Sunday off unless we are behind.    

**What platforms will you use to communicate?** 
* Slack. 

**How often will you take breaks?**  
* 15 min every 2 hours, or when we are feeling overwhelmed we can take time away from the project. Communicate with the group on how long you will be away.    

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**  
* At the beginning of each meeting the group will convene to go over what needs to be done and any blockers. At this time we can assess the progress of the project and see if help is needed in areas to bring us back on schedule.  

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**  
* Messages through slack. 

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**  
* Give everyone time to discuss what they are working on and what they need help with.  

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**  
* The team will proactively engage with all members so that they don’t feel left behind and they feel heard. If we feel someone is being rude, any member can call them out and invite them to another table (in remo) to take a break.  

### Work Plan
The work plan should be explained to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” and “siloed” efforts. 
NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.  

**How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?** 
* We will use Trello to identify, assign, and manage project work.  

**What project management tool will be used?**  
* Trello. 

### Presentation Deck
A copy of the Presentation Deck Template has to be made, so team members can work on the same file. Link to the shared doc in your project plan.
**Mid Project:** [Chewy Infrastructure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nIfo6rMmLCAd9vQiol_x_NyfFSv9k7PM/view?usp=sharing)

### Schedule your practice session
The team will pre-schedule a date and time with the instructor for a “practice run” presentation. This practice should get really close if not exact to the time already predetermined. A 30 to 45 minute meeting before the actual presentation should take place to allow time for a practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

**Reminders for the presentation:**
* Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
* When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
* Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

### Git Process
Team’s Git workflow should be planned to see how it will look like, for coding tasks.  

**What components of your project will live on GitHub?**  
* Automated shell script.
* Team agreement README.md.   
* Network security assesment

**How will you share the repository with your teammates?**    
* The link has been shared through slack and every member has full control in github.

**What is your Git flow?**    
* We will use “Trunk Based Development”.   

**Will you be using a PR review workflow? How many people must review a PR?**  
* Two people. 

**Who merges PRs?**  
* The person who made the most recent change. 

**How often will you merge?**  
* After any major change or addition to the repository.

**How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?**  
* Slack message.
